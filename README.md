# Tic-tac-toe Game

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

Tic-tac-toe game app using vanilla Javascript.

I made it to practice organizing Javascript code by using factory functions and modules.

It can be played against another human, or two types of AIs. The first chooses a play at random, while the second uses the Minimax algorithm to be basically unbeatable.

Build as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
